# Copy Ruby REPL Reference

This extension is heavily based on [Copy Ruby Member Reference](https://github.com/ricobl/copy-ruby-member-reference). There is one difference: instance methods are copied with a period instead of a hash, e.g. `Class.instance_method` instead of `Class#instance_method`.

## Features

This extension adds a new command, "Copy Ruby REPL Reference," to the Command Palette. It copies the reference under the cursor.
